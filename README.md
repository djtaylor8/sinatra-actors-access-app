 # Access Actors - Sinatra Content Management System App

Access Actors is an app that allows users to create profiles, view and register for auditions, and view other actors. A broader implementation of this app would include access for agents/casting agencies to access actor profiles and create new auditions. Also, giving users the ability to upload images/resumes would extend functionality across the board. More features like these to come in the future!

### Installing

Clone this repo onto your device and run 'bundle install' for all necessary gems. Basic functionality will work without seed data, but you can run 'rake db:seed' to have access to headshots located in the 'public/images' folder.

When entering headshot images into a new or existing profile, only enter the headshot's name in the text field (see below).

    Image Names: kbt_1, djt_1, han, kbt_2, kbt_3, lbj, tobias_blue, tobias_doc
